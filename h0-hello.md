# Preparation for the course
To get things running smoothly, we are advised to create a repository for this course and publish our work as we progress with things.

# Prerequisites
One should have such a computer where virtual environment can be created. One thing that I still need to work on since at the moment I don't have proper laptop where to install virtual environments.
